# 42-printf

## Overview
this project is a recoding of the famous `printf`in C, where its important to uderstand what a variadic function is and how to work with it and access its elements via macros like va_list va_start va_arg ...

## Core Concepts
  - Variadic functions
  - Handling format specifiers
  - understanding of low-level function implementation

## Getting started
  1. Clone this repository
       ```bash
       git clone https://github.com/akarichan00/1337-printf.git
       ```
  2. Enter the repository and Compile the files using make:
      ```bash
      cd 1337-printf
      make
      ```
  3. Use it in your code
     To use the library functions in your code, clone it in your project's root folder and simply include its header:
     ```bash
     #include "ft_printf.h"
     ```
